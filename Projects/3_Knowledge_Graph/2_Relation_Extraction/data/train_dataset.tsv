47	[E11:malware] KopiLuwak [E12:malware] In November 2016, Kaspersky Lab observed a new round of weaponized macro documents that dropped a new, heavily obfuscated Javascript payload that we named [E21:malware] KopiLuwak [E22:malware] (one of the rarest and most expensive types of coffee in the world).	0	other
48	In line with this approach, we will present more on this [E11:malware] Zebrocy [E12:malware] innovation and activity playing out at SAS 2019 in [E21:location] Singapore [E22:location].	1	attack
49	However, we later observed more activity by the [E11:malware] OlympicDestroyer [E12:malware] subset in [E21:location] Europe [E22:location] and Ukraine, and it was then that we decided to treat it as the entity we call Hades.	1	attack
50	During the past few months, [E11:attacker] APT34 [E12:attacker] has been able to quickly incorporate exploits for at least two publicly vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-0199 and [E21:vulnerability] CVE-2017-11882 [E22:vulnerability]) to target organizations in the Middle East.	2	use
51	Major airlines, airports and other transportation companies were also targeted, as were telecommunications operators, defense companies, technology providers, government agencies and educational institutions storing vital research. “During intense intelligence gathering over the last 24 months, we observed the technical capabilities of the Operation [E11:attacker] Cleaver [E12:attacker] team rapidly evolve faster than any previously observed [E21:location] Iranian [E22:location] effort.	3	from

67	The goal of the attacks doesn’t appear to have been immediate financial gain; rather the [E11:attacker] Platinum [E12:attacker] APT group is up to a broader economic espionage campaign using stolen information. The group has been targeting countries in South and Southeast Asia since at least 2009, with Malaysia being its biggest victim, following [E21:location] Indonesia [E22:location], China, and India.	1	attack
68	Perhaps open source offensive malware will become much more present in [E11:malware] Mosquito [E12:malware] and Carbon attacks as we see more meterpreter and injector code, and more uniquely innovative complex malware will continue to be distributed with [E21:malware] KopiLuwak [E22:malware] and a possible return of WhiteBear.	0	other
69	[E11:attacker] APT39 [E12:attacker] frequently registers and leverages domains that masquerade as legitimate web services and organizations that are relevant to the intended target. Furthermore, this group has routinely identified and exploited vulnerable web servers of targeted organizations to install web shells, such as [E21:malware] ANTAK [E22:malware] and ASPXSPY, and used stolen legitimate credentials to compromise externally facing Outlook Web Access (OWA) resources.	2	use
70	Like previous [E11:attacker] Dragonfly [E12:attacker] campaigns, the hackers are using malicious email (containing very specific content related to the energy sector) attachments, watering hole attacks, and Trojanized software as an initial attack vector to gain access to a victim's network. The group is using a toolkit called [E21:tool] Phishery [E22:tool] (available on GitHub) to perform email-based attacks that host template injection attack to steal victim's credentials.	2	use
71	[E11:attacker] APT10 [E12:attacker] was especially active against [E21:location] Japanese [E22:location] victims, with new iterations of its malware, as was OceanLotus, which actively deployed watering holes targeting high-profile victims in South Asia with a new custom stager.	1	attack

793	The DNSMessenger malware is a shared tool, used by [E11:attacker] FIN7 [E12:attacker], [E21:attacker] MuddyWater [E22:attacker] and perhaps other groups – Unlikely We have attempted to find examples of code available in public data sources that would generate the variation of the DNSMessenger malware and had little luck in doing so.	0	other
794	[E11:attacker] FIN7 [E12:attacker] has been extremely active against the [E21:location] U.S. [E22:location] restaurant and hospitality industries since mid-2015.	1	attack
795	As a sidenote this exploit was first seen abused in [E11:malware] Sandworm [E12:malware] APT attacks against [E21:location] Poland [E22:location] and Ukraine.	1	attack
796	[E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker], also known as [E21:attacker] Sofacy [E22:attacker], is a Russian cyber-criminal group known to target high-profile government, military and security organizations using sophisticated tools and capabilities.	4	same
797	[E11:malware] Turla [E12:malware] uses the same XOR key and log file names as [E21:malware] Agent.btz [E22:malware], but we have to consider that it could be a diversionary strategy of the malware authors.	5	similar
798	According to KSN data, in addition to [E21:location] Taiwan [E22:location], there are some [E11:attacker] SVCMONDR [E12:attacker] victims in Thailand.	1	attack
799	It was created last October after Microsoft used a sinkhole to halt the original Kelihos botnet, which had infected about 41,000 computers.The latest [E11:malware] Kelihos [E12:malware] used servers with hosts registered in [E21:location] Sweden [E22:location], Russia and Ukraine that were controlled by a botmaster, according to CrowdStrike.	1	attack
800	[E11:attacker] ScarCruft [E12:attacker] is a relatively new APT group; victims have been observed in several countries, including Russia, Nepal, South Korea, [E21:location] China [E22:location], India, Kuwait and Romania.	1	attack
801	Believed to have started activity in 2009 and to originate from China, the [E11:attacker] group [E12:attacker] initially was known for targeting US and overseas defense contractors but broadened their targeting as time passed. They have targeted [E21:location] Japanese [E22:location] organizations since at least 2014.	1	attack
802	[E11:attacker] Danti [E12:attacker] is a relative newcomer operating since 2015 and primarily against Indian government organizations. It has recently branched out against targets in [E21:location] Kazakhstan [E22:location], Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the Philippines, Kaspersky said.	1	attack
803	In addition to Fancy Bear, [E11:attacker] Sednit [E12:attacker] is also known by other monikers, including APT28, Sofacy, Pawn Storm, [E21:attacker] STRONTIUM [E22:attacker] and Tsar Team.	4	same

806	Contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com The Epic [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] attacks The attacks in this campaign fall into several different categories depending on the vector used in the initial compromise: [E21:technique] Spearphishing [E22:technique] e-mails with Adobe PDF exploits (CVE-2013-3346 + CVE-2013-5065) Social engineering to trick the user into running malware installers with “.SCR” extension, sometimes packed with RAR Watering hole attacks using Java exploits (CVE-2012-1723), Flash exploits (unknown) or Internet Explorer 6,7,8 exploits (unknown) Watering hole attacks that rely on social engineering to trick the user into running fake “Flash Player” malware installers The attackers use both direct spearphishing and watering hole attacks to infect their victims.	2	use
807	[E11:attacker] APT32 [E12:attacker] operations are characterized through deployment of signature malware payloads including WINDSHIELD, [E21:malware] KOMPROGO [E22:malware], SOUNDBITE, and PHOREAL.	2	use
808	For example, the experts mentioned a malicious code dubbed [E11:malware] Fanny [E12:malware], which was used by the Equation Group in 2008 when it exploited two zero-days, later introduced into the [E21:malware] Stuxnet [E22:malware] variants detected in June 2009 and March 2010.	5	similar
809	[E11:malware] KopiLuwak [E12:malware] performs a more comprehensive system and network reconnaissance collection, and like [E21:malware] IcedCoffee [E22:malware] leaves very little on disk for investigators to discover other than the base script.	5	similar
810	In the case of the Cosmos attack, and in [E11:malware] Carbanak [E12:malware] and Anunak cyberattacks, international gangs phish their way into back-end systems, exploiting network access to install malware that removes fraud controls such as maximum withdrawal amounts, transfer funds to other [E21:industry] banks [E22:industry] and increases customer balances.	1	attack
811	FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence believes that [E11:attacker] APT37 [E12:attacker] is aligned with the activity publicly reported as Scarcruft and [E21:attacker] Group123 [E22:attacker].	5	similar
812	A number of the modules used by [E11:attacker] Danti [E12:attacker] have the same functionality as previously known and used malicious programs like NetTraveller and [E21:attacker] DragonOK [E22:attacker].	0	other

815	[E11:attacker] CozyDuke [E12:attacker] (also known as ‘CozyBear’, ‘CozyCar’ and ‘Office Monkeys’) targets government organisations and businesses in the US, Germany, South Korea and [E21:location] Uzbekistan [E22:location].	1	attack
816	The report linked [E11:attacker] APT1 [E12:attacker] to a unit within China's People's Liberation Army and received widespread attention from the media and from the [E21:location] U.S. [E22:location] government.	1	attack
817	Researchers have seen ongoing attacks targeting a number of companies in the hospitality sector, including [E11:industry] hotels [E12:industry] in at least seven countries in [E21:location] Europe [E22:location] and one Middle Eastern country.	3	from
818	From mid-2016 through early 2017, [E11:attacker] APT33 [E12:attacker] compromised a [E21:location] U.S. [E22:location] organization in the aerospace sector and targeted a business conglomerate located in Saudi Arabia with aviation holdings.	1	attack
819	Although we have only directly observed [E11:attacker] APT33 [E12:attacker] use DROPSHOT to deliver the [E21:malware] TURNEDUP [E22:malware] backdoor, we have identified multiple DROPSHOT samples in the wild that drop SHAPESHIFT.	2	use
820	But msnMM, naikon, sakto, and [E21:malware] rarstone [E22:malware] backdoors are all used by the same actor that we call the [E11:attacker] Naikon [E12:attacker] APT.	2	use
821	Similarly, we detected a [E21:technique] spearphishing [E22:technique] [E11:malware] GreyEnergy [E12:malware] document (a541295eca38eaa4fde122468d633083, exploiting CVE-2017-11882), also named “Seminar.rtf”. “Seminar.rtf”, a GreyEnergy decoy document This document downloads a GreyEnergy sample (78734cd268e5c9ab4184e1bbe21a6eb9) from the following SMB link: \\185.217.0[.]124\Doc\Seminar\Seminar_2018_1.AO-A The following Zebrocy samples use this server as C2: 7f20f7fbce9deee893dbce1a1b62827d 170d2721b91482e5cabf3d2fec091151 3803af6700ff4f712cd698cee262d4ac e3100228f90692a19f88d9acb620960d They retrieve additional data from the following URL: hxxp://185.217.0[.]124/help-desk/remote-assistant-service/PostId.php?q={hex} It is worth noting that at least two samples from the above list use both 193.23.181[.]151 and 185.217.0[.]124 as C2s.	2	use
822	In addition, [E11:malware] Emissary [E12:malware] appears to only be used against [E21:location] Taiwan [E22:location]ese or Hong Kong based targets, all of the decoys are written in Traditional Chinese, and they use themes related to the government or military.	1	attack
823	[E11:attacker] FIN7 [E12:attacker] In all Mandiant investigations to date where the CARBANAK [E21:technique] backdoor [E22:technique] has been discovered, the activity has been attributed to the FIN7 threat group.	2	use
824	We believe this is a relatively small group of attackers that are going after the supply chain — targeting government institutions, military contractors, maritime and ship-building groups, telecom operators, satellite operators, industrial and high technology companies and mass media, mainly in South Korea and [E21:location] Japan [E22:location]. This [E11:attacker] Icefog [E12:attacker] campaigns rely on custom-made cyber-espionage tools for Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X.	1	attack

827	ELMER beacon APT16 While attribution of the first two spear phishing attacks is still uncertain, we attribute the second December [E21:technique] phishing [E22:technique] campaign to the China-based APT group that we refer to as [E11:attacker] APT16 [E12:attacker].	2	use
828	Recent [E11:attacker] menuPass [E12:attacker] activity and some ties to older infrastructure The C2 infrastructure in these attacks is largely actor registered, with only a few Dynamic Domain Name System ([E21:tool] DDNS [E22:tool]) domains. menuPass typically makes use of a mix of DDNS and actor-registered domains in their attack campaigns.	2	use
829	The new [E21:technique] rootkit [E22:technique] family was called [E11:malware] Umbreon [E12:malware] (ELF_UMBREON family), from the name of one of the Pokémon characters.	2	use
830	In this latest campaign, [E11:attacker] APT34 [E12:attacker] leveraged the recent Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 to deploy POWRUNER and [E21:malware] BONDUPDATER [E22:malware].	2	use

832	[E11:malware] IcedCoffee [E12:malware] is a fairly basic [E21:technique] backdoor [E22:technique] which uses WMI to collect a variety of system and user information from the system, which is then encoded with base64, encrypted with RC4 and submitted via HTTP POST to the C2 server.	2	use
833	Izmeneniya v prikaz PK.doc’ Zebrocy decoy document translation: ‘Changes to order, Republic of Kazakhstan’ The two C2 servers discussed above were actively used by Zebrocy and GreyEnergy almost at the same time: [E21:ip] 193.23.181[.]151 [E22:ip] was used by GreyEnergy and [E11:malware] Zebrocy [E12:malware] in June 2018 185.217.0[.]124 was used by GreyEnergy between May and June 2018 and by Zebrocy in June 2018 Conclusions The GreyEnergy/BlackEnergy actor is an advanced group that possesses extensive knowledge on penetrating into their victim´s networks and exploiting any vulnerabilities it finds.	2	use
834	Conclusions The [E11:attacker] Hellsing [E12:attacker] APT group is currently active in the APAC region, hitting targets mainly in the South China Sea area, with a focus on [E21:location] Malaysia [E22:location], the Philippines and Indonesia.	1	attack
835	And it’s turning up in some unexpected places: In December, [E11:malware] Coinhive [E12:malware] code was found embedded in all Web pages served by a WiFi hotspot at a [E21:industry] Starbucks [E22:industry] in Buenos Aires.	1	attack
836	Just a few days later, FireEye reported on a [E11:attacker] TEMP.Periscope [E12:attacker] campaign targeting the Cambodian elections in July 2018 that used the open directory hosted on scsnewstoday[.]com as a [E21:technique] C2 [E22:technique].	2	use
837	Once [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] hackers gain the control of Satellite's user system, the hackers instruct the infected [E21:technique] botnet [E22:technique] computers to send the stolen data to the command-and-control (C&C) server (compromised satellite user).	2	use
838	[E11:malware] BADNEWS [E12:malware] is particularly interesting, containing resilient [E21:technique] command-and-control [E22:technique] (C&C) capability using RSS feeds, Github, forums, blogs and Dynamic DNS hosts.	2	use
839	[E11:malware] CosmicDuke [E12:malware] servers had a long list of victims (139 unique IPs) starting from April 2012. Its presence was observed all over the world including Georgia, Russia, US, Great Britain, Kazakhstan, India, Belarus, [E21:location] Cyprus [E22:location], Ukraine and Lithuania.	1	attack

841	Many known APT network infiltration incidents in the past few years, notably the Chinese army APT1 and APT30 and the [E21:location] Russian [E22:location] army [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker], were related to cyber-espionage and intelligence gathering for national interests.	3	from
842	TEMP.Periscope Background Active since at least 2013, [E11:attacker] TEMP.Periscope [E12:attacker] has primarily focused on maritime-related targets across multiple verticals, including engineering firms, shipping and transportation, manufacturing, defense, government offices, and research universities (targeting is summarized in Figure 1). The group has also targeted professional/consulting services, [E21:industry] high-tech [E22:industry] industry, healthcare, and media/publishing.	1	attack
843	This is proof that the hacking team had access to previously unknown flaws before any other group of hackers. “At least four of these were used as [E21:vulnerability] zero-days [E22:vulnerability] by the [E11:attacker] EQUATION [E12:attacker] group.	2	use
844	Today we release a new report: [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker]: A Window Into [E21:location] Russia [E22:location]’s Cyber Espionage Operations? This report focuses on a threat group that we have designated as APT28.	3	from

846	Despite this, based on the chain of analysis above we cannot discount the notion that [E21:malware] DNSMessenger [E22:malware] is shared by multiple attackers, including [E11:attacker] FIN7 [E12:attacker] and MuddyWater.	2	use
847	Around the time of that breakthrough incident, when around 230,000 people were left without electricity, we started detecting another malware framework and named it [E11:malware] GreyEnergy [E12:malware]. It has since been used to attack [E21:industry] energy [E22:industry] companies and other high-value targets in Ukraine and Poland for the past three years.	1	attack
848	0375 ESET’s analysis of a recent backdoor used by [E11:attacker] TeleBots [E12:attacker] – the group behind the massive [E21:malware] NotPetya [E22:malware] ransomware outbreak – uncovers strong code similarities to the Industroyer main backdoor, revealing a rumored connection that was not previously proven Among the most significant malware-induced cybersecurity incidents in recent years were the attacks against the Ukrainian power grid – which resulted in unprecedented blackouts two years in a row – and the devastating NotPetya ransomware outbreak.	2	use
849	In addition to the Hellsing/[E11:malware] msger [E12:malware] malware, we’ve identified a second generation of Trojan samples which appear to be called “[E21:malware] xweber [E22:malware]” by the attackers: “Xweber” seems to be the more recent Trojan, taking into account compilation timestamps.	5	similar
850	The [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker] group has constantly updated their software and made the resulting binaries difficult to reverse engineer. It used a downloader tool that FireEye dubbed "[E21:malware] SOURFACE [E22:malware]", a backdoor labelled "EVILTOSS" that gives hackers remote access and a flexible modular implant called "CHOPSTICK" to enhance functionality of the espionage software.	2	use
851	[E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] APT group, which was named after its notorious software [E21:malware] Epic [E22:malware] Turla, is abusing satellite-based Internet connections in order to: Siphon sensitive data from government, military, diplomatic, research and educational organisations in the United States and Europe.	2	use

853	Zeus and [E11:malware] SpyEye [E12:malware] were the two main families of [E21:technique] botnet [E22:technique] software.	2	use
854	We observed constant activity from this group targeting different regions including [E21:location] Turkey [E22:location], other parts of Asia and Latin America, as well as various lines of business that provide it with financial gain, such as casinos, financial institutions and cryptocurrencies. In its more recent campaigns it has started deploying a new malware we call [E11:malware] ThreatNeedle [E12:malware].	1	attack
855	Details on this attachment are as follows: The file (11227eca89cc053fb189fac3ebf27497) with the name “Seminar.rtf” exploited CVE-2017-0199 “Seminar.rtf” downloaded a second stage document from: hxxp://193.23.181[.]151/Seminar.rtf (4de5adb865b5198b4f2593ad436fceff, exploiting CVE-2017-11882) The original document (Seminar.rtf) was hosted on the same server and downloaded by victims from: hxxp://193.23.181[.]151/ministerstvo-energetiki/seminars/2019/06/Seminar.rtf Another server we detected that was used both by [E11:malware] Zebrocy [E12:malware] and by [E21:malware] GreyEnergy [E22:malware] is 185.217.0[.]124.	0	other

857	And, on a few occasions, it has been deployed alongside a never documented Windows rootkit and bootkit (which curiously shares some of its code with the infamous [E11:malware] BlackEnergy [E12:malware] malware linked to attacks on Ukrainian [E21:industry] energy [E22:industry] distribution companies.	1	attack
858	A SEDRECO plugin identified by the researchers was found to share code with a module used by [E21:malware] XAGENT [E22:malware], the other backdoor utilized by the [E11:attacker] Sednit [E12:attacker] gang.	2	use
859	However, over the past few years, we have been tracking a separate, less widely known suspected [E21:location] Iranian [E22:location] group with potential destructive capabilities, whom we call [E11:attacker] APT33 [E12:attacker].	3	from
860	Conclusion FireEye believes the change from [E21:malware] RIPTIDE [E22:malware] to HIGHTIDE represents a temporary tool shift to decrease malware detection while [E11:attacker] APT12 [E12:attacker] developed a completely new malware toolset.	2	use

890	0267 Summary The [E11:attacker] Sofacy [E12:attacker] group remains a persistent global threat. Unit 42 and others have shown in the first half of 2018 how this threat actor group continues to target multiple organizations throughout the world with a strong emphasis on government, diplomatic and other strategic organizations primarily in North America and [E21:location] Europe [E22:location].	1	attack
891	We assess that [E11:attacker] APT10 [E12:attacker] likely compromised [E21:industry] Visma [E22:industry] with the primary goal of enabling secondary intrusions onto their client networks, and not of stealing Visma intellectual property.	1	attack

955	[E11:malware] Glupteba [E12:malware]’s [E21:technique] C&C [E22:technique] servers were also hosted on machines that were part of Windigo’s botnet.	2	use
956	The [E21:malware] Epic [E22:malware] [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] operation reported in 2014 involved highly selective Carbon delivery and was a long term global operation that affected hundreds of victims.	2	use
957	Malicious [E21:tool] Macro [E22:tool] Analysis When the victim opens the [E11:malware] ThreeDollars [E12:malware] document they are presented with the lure image and prompted to click on the “Enable Content” button.	2	use
958	There has since been a flurry of reporting on [E11:attacker] TEMP.Periscope [E12:attacker] activity in 2018, with campaigns against American and [E21:location] European [E22:location] maritime engineering companies and the Cambodian government.	1	attack
959	This advanced exfiltration technique is classic Turla and cemented the belief that the [E21:malware] Agent.BTZ [E22:malware] actor and [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] were one and the same.	2	use
960	Hosts associated with GreyEnergy and Zebrocy Attacked company Additionally, both [E11:malware] GreyEnergy [E12:malware] and Zebrocy [E21:technique] spearphishing [E22:technique] documents targeted a number of industrial companies in Kazakhstan.	2	use
961	The goal of the attacks doesn’t appear to have been immediate financial gain; rather the [E11:attacker] Platinum [E12:attacker] APT group is up to a broader economic espionage campaign using stolen information. The group has been targeting countries in South and Southeast Asia since at least 2009, with [E21:location] Malaysia [E22:location] being its biggest victim, following Indonesia, China, and India.	1	attack
962	Conclusion [E21:malware] DealersChoice [E22:malware] is an exploit platform that allows the [E11:attacker] Sofacy [E12:attacker] threat group to exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash.	2	use
963	The group targeted organizations in multiple industries, including [E11:industry] aviation [E12:industry], investment, government and education organizations in several countries (i.e. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, [E21:location] Bahrain [E22:location], Qatar, Kuwait and Turkey, and a Saudi company in Australia). “Greenbug was discovered targeting a range of organizations in the Middle East including companies in the aviation, energy, government, investment, and education sectors.	3	from
964	Essentially, we are discussing ongoing activity revolving around several malware families: KopiLuwak and IcedCoffeer Carbon Mosquito WhiteBear Technical Rattle Turla’s Shifting to Scripting KopiLuwak and IcedCoffee, WhiteBear, and WhiteAtlas Since at least 2015 [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] has leveraged Javascript, [E21:tool] powershell [E22:tool], and wsh in a number of ways, including in their malware dropper/installation operations as well as for implementing complete backdoors.	2	use
965	We also discovered that LuckyMouse unleashed a new wave of activity targeting [E21:location] Asian [E22:location] [E11:industry] governmental [E12:industry] organizations just around the time they had gathered for a summit in China.	3	from
966	In 2014, Kaspersky announced the discovery of [E21:malware] Penquin [E22:malware] [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker], a Linux backdoor leveraged by Turla in specific attacks.	2	use
967	Old hash function, used in previous versions of the Duqu driver: New hash function: The fact that the new driver was found in [E21:location] Iran [E22:location] confirms that most of [E11:malware] Duqu [E12:malware] incidents are related to this country.	3	from
968	The changes to RIPTIDE were significant enough to circumvent existing [E11:malware] RIPTIDE [E12:malware] detection rules. FireEye dubbed this new malware family [E21:malware] HIGHTIDE [E22:malware].	5	similar
969	APT-style [E21:industry] bank [E22:industry] robberies increase with Metel, [E11:attacker] GCMAN [E12:attacker] and Carbanak 2.0 attacks.	1	attack
970	Codenamed [E11:attacker] Sowbug [E12:attacker], the hacking group has been exposed by Symantec security researchers, who spotted the group conducting clandestine attacks against foreign policy institutions, government bodies and diplomatic targets in countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and [E21:location] Malaysia [E22:location].	1	attack
971	The TwoForOne (Platinum) group is described in Microsoft research, [E11:attacker] APT16 [E12:attacker] in FireEye reports, and EvilPost and [E21:attacker] Danti [E22:attacker] in Kaspersky Lab private reports.	0	other
972	To date, [E11:attacker] Sowbug [E12:attacker] appears to be focused mainly on [E21:industry] government [E22:industry] entities in South America and Southeast Asia and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Brunei and Malaysia," the Symantec report said.	1	attack
973	On August 30, 2018, [E11:attacker] APT10 [E12:attacker] deployed their first modified version of [E21:malware] Trochilus [E22:malware] that had its C2 communications encrypted using Salsa20 and RC4 ciphers instead of the more common RC4-encrypted Trochilus variant seen in the wild.	2	use
974	Other examples of malicious infrastructure registered with internet.bs include domains for [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker]’s [E21:malware] VPNFilter [E22:malware] malware campaign and the registration of the cyber-berkut[.]org domain that was affiliated with the pro-Russian and potentially Russian state-linked threat actor CyberBerkut.	2	use
975	TEMP.Periscope Background Active since at least 2013, [E11:attacker] TEMP.Periscope [E12:attacker] has primarily focused on maritime-related targets across multiple verticals, including engineering firms, shipping and transportation, manufacturing, defense, [E21:industry] government [E22:industry] offices, and research universities (targeting is summarized in Figure 1).	1	attack
976	MS14-058 patches yet another kernel level font handling flaw CVE-2014-4148, the same kind of issue seen in the [E11:malware] Duqu [E12:malware] [E21:technique] spearphish [E22:technique] exploits.	2	use
977	The “servicereset.exe” file is a new tool in [E11:attacker] OilRig [E12:attacker]’s arsenal that we call [E21:malware] ISMInjector [E22:malware], which we will discuss in detail in the next section.	2	use
978	The [E11:attacker] group [E12:attacker] has also extended its geographic reach to include victims in North Korea, Russia, South Korea, Japan, Bangladesh, Thailand, India, Mozambique and [E21:location] Germany [E22:location] Data breaches There has been a steady stream of security breaches this year.	1	attack
979	Turla APT [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] is the name of a Russian cyber espionage ATP group (also known as Waterbug, Venomous Bear, and KRYPTON) that has been active since at least 2007 targeting government organizations and private [E21:industry] businesses [E22:industry].	1	attack
980	The attackers realized they were under investigation and planted a false flag – Possible The attackers realized they were under investigation and planted a false flag on their C2 server, uploading a copy of the [E11:attacker] FIN7 [E12:attacker] [E21:malware] DNSMessenger [E22:malware] code which had been previously mentioned (and was since publicly available) by FireEye and delivering it to researchers to trick them into mis-attributing the campaign.	2	use
981	Despite rumours of the [E21:location] Russian [E22:location] [E11:industry] government [E12:industry]'s alleged involvement in high-profile government and military cyber attacks, there has been little hard evidence of any link to cyber espionage," Dan McWhorter, FireEye vice president of Threat Intelligence, wrote in a blog post discussing the report.	3	from
982	0557 Summary In the past few months, Unit 42 has observed the [E11:attacker] Patchwork [E12:attacker] group, alternatively known as Dropping Elephant and [E21:attacker] Monsoon [E22:attacker], conducting campaigns against targets located in the Indian subcontinent.	4	same
983	Outlook We believe [E11:attacker] APT39 [E12:attacker]'s significant targeting of the telecommunications and [E21:industry] travel [E22:industry] industries reflects efforts to collect personal information on targets of interest and customer data for the purposes of surveillance to facilitate future operations.	1	attack
984	[E11:malware] MobileOrder [E12:malware] acts on instructions provided by its [E21:technique] C2 [E22:technique] server, which it communicates with over TCP port 3728.	2	use
985	Following the initial [E21:technique] phishing [E22:technique] scheme that allowed [E11:attacker] APT1 [E12:attacker] to reach the victims’ computer networks, hundreds of terabytes of data were stolen over the years before the discovery.	2	use
986	The primary backdoor used in the [E11:malware] Epic [E12:malware] attacks is also known as “WorldCupSec”, “[E21:malware] TadjMakhal [E22:malware]”, “Wipbot” or “Tavdig”.	5	similar
987	Executive Summary Insikt Group assesses that a [E11:malware] Mirai [E12:malware] [E21:technique] botnet [E22:technique] variant, possibly linked to the IoTroop or Reaper botnet, was utilized in attacks on at least one company, and probably more, in the financial sector in late January 2018.	2	use

1053	We also discovered [E11:malware] Komplex [E12:malware] command and control ([E21:technique] C2 [E22:technique]) domains that overlapped with previously identified phishing campaign infrastructures associated with the Sofacy group,” researchers said. “We believe (it) may have been done in order to handle compromised Windows and OS X systems using the same C2 server application with relative ease.” “The Sofacy group created the Komplex Trojan to use in attack campaigns targeting the OS X operating system – a move that showcases their continued evolution toward multi-platform attacks,” they added.	2	use
1054	Our analysis indicates that victims are infected via a sophisticated multi-stage attack, which begins with the [E21:malware] Epic [E22:malware] [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker].	2	use
1055	Once [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] hackers gain the control of [E21:industry] Satellite [E22:industry]'s user system, the hackers instruct the infected botnet computers to send the stolen data to the command-and-control (C&C) server (compromised satellite user).	1	attack
1056	In the investigations Mandiant has conducted, it appeared that [E11:attacker] APT29 [E12:attacker] deployed [E21:malware] POSHSPY [E22:malware] as a secondary backdoor for use if they lost access to their primary backdoors.	2	use
1057	[E11:attacker] APT39 [E12:attacker] has prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the [E21:industry] travel [E22:industry] industry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry.	1	attack
1058	Finally, I will discuss the recent cyber espionage campaigns discovered by researchers at Hungary-based CrySyS Lab –a decade-long activity that targeted high-level [E21:industry] political [E22:industry] and industrial entities in Eastern Europe. The attackers, dubbed by security researchers [E11:attacker] TeamSpy [E12:attacker], used a digital signed version of the popular remote control software TeamViewer specially crafted with a malware to steal secret documents and encryption keys from victims.	1	attack
1059	Department of Justice issued an international indictment against five Chinese soldiers of [E11:attacker] APT1 [E12:attacker] for cybercrime acts ranging from [E21:technique] spear-phishing [E22:technique] and data theft to industrial espionage.	2	use
1060	The [E21:technique] spear-phishing [E22:technique] campaign used to leverage the zero-day vulnerability is believed to have been conducted by hacker group [E11:attacker] Strontium [E12:attacker], also known as Pawn Storm, APT28, Fancy Bear, Sednit, Sofacy and Tsar Team.	2	use

1070	In the past, the [E11:attacker] Sofacy [E12:attacker] developers modified earlier [E21:malware] AZZY [E22:malware] backdoors to use a C&C server encoded in the registry, instead of storing it in the malware itself, so this code modularisation follows the same line of thinking.	2	use
1071	[E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker] has also focused on intrusions into [E21:location] Georgia [E22:location]’s Ministry of Defense further exemplifying their focus on regional geopolitical threats.	1	attack

1388	In one remarkable case, the [E11:malware] Carbanak [E12:malware] 2.0 gang used its access to a [E21:industry] financial [E22:industry] institution that stores information about shareholders to change the ownership details of a large company.	1	attack
1389	In this blog post we provide additional information linking [E11:attacker] TEMP.Veles [E12:attacker] and their activity surrounding the [E21:malware] TRITON [E22:malware] intrusion to a Russian government-owned research institute.	2	use
1390	According to industry reporting, Chinese espionage group [E11:attacker] TEMP.Periscope [E12:attacker] has conducted large-scale [E21:technique] phishing [E22:technique], intrusion, remote access trojan (RAT), and data exfiltration activity since at least 2013.	2	use
1391	Indicative of its importance, the final whitepaper into [E11:attacker] Sednit [E12:attacker] is focused on [E21:malware] Downdelph [E22:malware], a first-stage piece of malware which, despite its limited use by the cyberattackers, offers amazing insight into how the group approaches certain targets.	2	use
1392	We believe both attacks used the same infrastructure as a reported campaign by Chinese threat actor [E11:attacker] TEMP.Periscope [E12:attacker] (also known as [E21:attacker] Leviathan [E22:attacker]), which targeted Cambodian entities in the run-up to their July 2018 elections.	4	same
1393	Also in this case, bad actors behind [E11:attacker] Dragonfly [E12:attacker] have used different attack techniques, including watering hole attacks, [E21:technique] spear-phishing [E22:technique] emails and trojanized ICS software updates as observed in the case of Havex RAT.	2	use
1394	TEMP.Periscope Background Active since at least 2013, [E11:attacker] TEMP.Periscope [E12:attacker] has primarily focused on maritime-related targets across multiple verticals, including engineering firms, shipping and [E21:industry] transportation [E22:industry], manufacturing, defense, government offices, and research universities.	1	attack
1395	We attribute this campaign to the Chinese-speaking threat actor [E11:attacker] LuckyMouse [E12:attacker] (aka [E21:attacker] EmissaryPanda [E22:attacker] and APT27) because of the tools and tactics used in the campaign, because the C2 domain, update.iaacstudio[.]com, was previously used by this group and because they have previously targeted government organizations, including those in Central Asia.	4	same

1504	Did the Russian government direct the group responsible for the breaches and related data leaks? If so, is this simply a matter of accepted state espionage, or did it cross a line? Was the breach at the Democratic National Committee part of a concerted effort by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election? The most consequential question remains unasked: How will Russia continue to employ a variety of methods – including hacks and leaks – to undermine the institutions, policies and actors that the Russian government perceives as constricting and condemning its forceful pursuit of its state aims? FireEye’s visibility into the operations of [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker] – a group we believe the [E21:location] Russian [E22:location] government sponsors – has given us insight into some of the government’s targets, as well as its objectives and the activities designed to further them.	3	from
