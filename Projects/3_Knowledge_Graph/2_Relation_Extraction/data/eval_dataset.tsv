5	The [E11:attacker] Sednit [E12:attacker] group — also known as Strontium, APT28, Fancy Bear or [E21:attacker] Sofacy [E22:attacker] — is a group of attackers operating since 2004, if not earlier, and whose main objective is to steal confidential information from specific targets.	4	same
6	We can hypothesize that the [E11:attacker] Sednit [E12:attacker] group added another layer of checking on its targets by dropping an [E21:malware] Xagent [E22:malware] with just a few modules and if the victim is interesting enough, it will drop another version with all modules.	2	use
7	Older documents used by [E11:attacker] Patchwork [E12:attacker] focused on the [E21:vulnerability] CVE-2017-0261 [E22:vulnerability] vulnerability, however in late January 2018 when, paradoxically, newer documents abandoned this vulnerability to attack the older CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability.	2	use
8	All [E11:attacker] APT1 [E12:attacker] had to do was to repeat the same attack pattern: Conduct inter-departmental [E21:technique] spear-phishing [E22:technique] based on newly acquired information and plant more RATs to escalate its privileges to access wider and deeper the victim’s database.	2	use

29	[E11:attacker] ScarCruft [E12:attacker] is a relatively new APT group; victims have been observed in several countries, including Russia, Nepal, South Korea, China, India, [E21:location] Kuwait [E22:location] and Romania.	1	attack
30	Incriminating evidence was missing, however – until the same ESET researchers picked apart a piece of malware that they code-named [E11:malware] Win32/Exaramel [E12:malware] and that shared significant code similarities with the main [E21:malware] Industroyer [E22:malware] backdoor.	5	similar
31	0133 Less than a week after Microsoft issued a patch for CVE-2017-11882 on Nov. 14, 2017, FireEye observed an attacker using an exploit for the Microsoft Office vulnerability to target a [E21:industry] government [E22:industry] organization in the Middle East. We assess this activity was carried out by a suspected Iranian cyber espionage threat group, whom we refer to as [E11:attacker] APT34 [E12:attacker], using a custom PowerShell backdoor to achieve its objectives.	1	attack
32	In particular, the [E11:attacker] group [E12:attacker] used their malware to attack [E21:industry] companies [E22:industry], financial institutions, radio and television.	1	attack

114	We believe that the Ke3chang attackers are operating out of China and have been active since at least 2010,"The cyber espionage campaign named as “Operation [E11:attacker] Ke3chang [E12:attacker]” and if the victim will download & open the malware file which disguised itself as files detailing a possible intervention in Syria (US_military_options_in_Syria.pdf.zip), it gets installed on the victim's computer with a [E21:technique] backdoor [E22:technique].	2	use
115	The hypothesis of state-sponsored hackers The researchers at FireEye explained that the [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker] focused its hacking campaigns on targets that would be of interest to Russia, such as the Caucasus region with a focus on [E21:location] Georgia [E22:location]. “Despite rumors of the Russian government’s alleged involvement in high-profile government and military cyber-attacks, there has been little hard evidence of any link to cyberespionage,” said Dan McWhorter, FireEye vice president of threat intelligence. “FireEye’s latest advance persistent threat report sheds light on cyberespionage operations that we assess to be most likely sponsored by the Russian government, long believed to be a leader among major nations in performing sophisticated network attacks.	1	attack
116	FireEye Intelligence has previously reported that [E11:attacker] APT33 [E12:attacker] has ties to destructive malware, and they pose a heightened risk to critical infrastructure.

178	In this case, TA459 had been using a trojan called [E11:malware] ZeroT [E12:malware] to exploit [E21:vulnerability] CVE-2017-0199 [E22:vulnerability].	2	use
179	The [E11:attacker] Dragonfly [E12:attacker] group, also know by other vendors as Energetic Bear, seems to have been operating since at least 2011, when it targeted defense and [E21:industry] aviation [E22:industry] companies in the US and Canada.	1	attack
180	This group, which we call ‘The [E11:attacker] Lamberts [E12:attacker]’ (but which is also known as ‘Longhorn’) first came to the attention of the security community in 2014, when researchers from FireEye discovered an attack using a zero-day vulnerability ([E21:vulnerability] CVE-2014-4148 [E22:vulnerability]).	2	use
181	Throughout August 2018, the [E11:attacker] APT10 [E12:attacker] actors regularly logged in to the Visma network via accessible [E21:tool] Citrix [E22:tool] servers using two valid user accounts.	2	use
182	Most recently, the [E11:malware] NetTraveler [E12:malware] groups main domains of interest for cyber-espionage activities include space exploration, nanotechnology, energy production, nuclear power, lasers, medicine and [E21:industry] communications [E22:industry].	1	attack
183	We believe the targeting of the Saudi organisation may have been an attempt to gain insight into regional rivals, while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South Korea’s recent partnerships with Iran’s petrochemical industry as well as South Korea’s relationships with [E21:location] Saudi [E22:location] [E11:industry] petrochemical [E12:industry] companies," the FireEye report reads.	3	from
184	In February, malware researchers at Kaspersky Lab discovered a new piece of JavaScript malware linked to the [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] APT group that was used in targeted attacks against organizations in [E21:location] Greece [E22:location], Qatar, and Romania.	1	attack
185	[E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] has been used in espionage campaigns against municipal [E21:industry] governments [E22:industry], embassies, militaries and other industrial targets, primarily in the Middle East and Europe.	1	attack
186	Overview Targeted attacks and malware campaigns Monkey business Recently we published our analysis of [E11:attacker] CozyDuke [E12:attacker], yet another cyber-espionage APT from the ‘Duke’ family – which also includes MiniDuke, [E21:malware] CosmicDuke [E22:malware] and OnionDuke.	2	use
187	Data from FireEye technologies shows that this campaign was widely distributed primarily to organizations in the United States, and across diverse industries including government, financial services, [E21:industry] manufacturing [E22:industry], service providers, and high-tech. Once a victim opened the attachment and enabled macros, it downloaded and executed an instance of the [E11:malware] TrickBot [E12:malware] malware from a remote server.	1	attack
188	Figure 2: Excerpt of an APT33 malicious .hta file We assess [E11:attacker] APT33 [E12:attacker] used a built-in [E21:technique] phishing [E22:technique] module within the publicly available ALFA TEaM Shell (aka ALFASHELL) to send hundreds of spear phishing emails to targeted individuals in 2016.	2	use
189	[E11:attacker] APT33 [E12:attacker]’s focus on aviation may indicate the group’s desire to gain insight into regional military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran’s [E21:industry] aviation [E22:industry] capabilities or to support Iran’s military and strategic decision making.	0	other

193	During the Visma intrusion, [E11:attacker] APT10 [E12:attacker] deployed their Trochilus malware with command and control ([E21:technique] C2 [E22:technique]) communications encrypted using both RC4 and Salsa20 streaming ciphers rather than the typically observed RC4 variant.	2	use
194	In June 2016, researchers from Kaspersky reported that the [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] APT had started using [E21:technique] rootkit [E22:technique]), Epic Turla (Wipbot and Tavdig) and Gloog Turla.	2	use
195	We assess this activity was carried out by a suspected Iranian cyber espionage threat group, whom we refer to as [E11:attacker] APT34 [E12:attacker], using a custom PowerShell [E21:technique] backdoor [E22:technique] to achieve its objectives.	2	use
196	The suspected [E11:attacker] APT16 [E12:attacker] targeting of the Taiwanese [E21:industry] government [E22:industry] agency – in addition to the Taiwanese media organizations – further supports this possibility.	1	attack
197	Moreover, this crew's most unusual characteristic is that for several years the [E11:attacker] Darkhotel [E12:attacker] APT has maintained a capability to use hotel networks to follow and hit selected targets as they travel around the world.

205	0060 APT10 Background APT10 ([E11:attacker] MenuPass [E12:attacker] Group) is a Chinese cyber espionage group that FireEye has tracked since 2009. They have historically targeted construction and engineering, [E21:industry] aerospace [E22:industry], and telecom firms, and governments in the United States, Europe, and Japan.	1	attack
206	In March 2014, the French newspaper, Le Monde, published an article on a cyber-espionage toolset that had been identified by Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC): this toolset had been used in the ‘[E11:attacker] Snowglobe [E12:attacker]’ operation that targeted French-speaking media in [E21:location] Canada [E22:location], as well as Greece, France, Norway and some African countries.	1	attack

208	CARBANAK malware has been used heavily by [E11:attacker] FIN7 [E12:attacker] in previous operations. Victims Thus far, we have directly identified 11 targeted organizations in the following sectors: Financial services, with different victims having insurance, investment, card services, and loan focuses Transportation Retail [E21:industry] Education [E22:industry] IT services Electronics All these organizations are based in the United States, and many have international presences.	1	attack
209	The overlap in infrastructure with the scsnewstoday[.]com C2 domain is also key; the domain was publicly reported by FireEye as being used by [E11:attacker] TEMP.Periscope [E12:attacker] only a few days after the spearphish to the [E21:location] U.K. [E22:location] engineering company was sent, making it highly unlikely that another threat actor could have compromised the C2.	1	attack
210	We believe this is a relatively small group of attackers that are going after the supply chain — targeting [E21:industry] government [E22:industry] institutions, military contractors, maritime and ship-building groups, telecom operators, satellite operators, industrial and high technology companies and mass media, mainly in South Korea and Japan. This [E11:attacker] Icefog [E12:attacker] campaigns rely on custom-made cyber-espionage tools for Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X.	1	attack
211	0023 In this blog, we will take a closer look at the powerful, versatile [E21:technique] backdoor [E22:technique] known as CARBANAK (aka [E11:malware] Anunak [E12:malware]).	2	use
212	Researchers at security firm FireEye who analyzed the attacks observed malware and exploits associated with the notorious Russia-linked APT group known as [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker] (aka Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, [E21:attacker] Strontium [E22:attacker], Sofacy, Sednit, and Tsar Team).	4	same

214	The report issued by BAE demonstrated the existence of a powerful spyware know as [E11:malware] Turla [E12:malware], which compromised [E21:location] Ukraine [E22:location] systems more than any other country.	1	attack
215	The third persona, “SuperHard,” is the creator or a significant contributor to the [E21:malware] AURIGA [E22:malware] and BANGAT malware families which we have observed [E11:attacker] APT1 [E12:attacker] and other APT groups use. “SuperHard” discloses his location to be the Pudong New Area of Shanghai.	2	use
216	Recent menuPass activity and some ties to older infrastructure The C2 infrastructure in these attacks is largely actor registered, with only a few Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) domains. [E11:attacker] menuPass [E12:attacker] typically makes use of a mix of [E21:tool] DDNS [E22:tool] and actor-registered domains in their attack campaigns.	2	use
217	Moreover, this crew’s most unusual characteristic is that for several years the [E11:attacker] Darkhotel [E12:attacker] APT has maintained a capability to use [E21:industry] hotel [E22:industry] networks to follow and hit selected targets as they travel around the world.	1	attack
218	TEMP.Periscope Background Active since at least 2013, [E11:attacker] TEMP.Periscope [E12:attacker] has primarily focused on maritime-related targets across multiple verticals, including engineering firms, shipping and transportation, manufacturing, defense, government offices, and research universities (targeting is summarized in Figure 1). The group has also targeted professional/consulting services, high-tech industry, healthcare, and [E21:industry] media [E22:industry]/publishing.	1	attack
219	[E11:attacker] TEMP.Periscope [E12:attacker] used the same infrastructure for a range of activity against other more traditional targets, including the defense industrial base in the United States and a chemical company based in Europe. Our previous blog post focused on the group’s targeting of engineering and [E21:industry] maritime [E22:industry] entities in the United States.	1	attack
220	In this case, [E11:attacker] Sofacy [E12:attacker]’s [E21:malware] SPLM [E22:malware] (aka Xagent, aka CHOPSTICK) tool was found on the server, but it’s unclear what tactics were used by the APT to plant the malware.	2	use

227	IcedCoffee Turla’s first foray into full-fledged Javascript [E21:technique] backdoors [E22:technique] began with the usage of the [E11:malware] IcedCoffee [E12:malware] backdoor that we reported on in our private June 2016 “Ice Turla” report (available to customers of Kaspersky APT Intelligence Services), which led later to their more fully functional and complex, recently deployed, KopiLuwak backdoor.	2	use
228	A look to the APT28 Arsenal The [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker] group used for his hacking campaigns numerous common tools, including a downloader called Sourface (aka Sofacy), the backdoor Eviltoss and a modular implant dubbed [E21:malware] Chopstick [E22:malware].	2	use
229	[E11:malware] BUGJUICE [E12:malware] defaults to TCP using a custom binary protocol to communicate with the C2, but can also use HTTP and [E21:tool] HTTPs [E22:tool] if directed by the C2.	2	use
230	However, the WATERSPOUT campaign shared several traits with the RIPTIDE and [E21:malware] HIGHTIDE [E22:malware] campaign that we have attributed to [E11:attacker] APT12 [E12:attacker].	2	use
231	Noting that Turla was absent from the milestone DNC hack event where [E11:attacker] Sofacy [E12:attacker] and [E21:attacker] CozyDuke [E22:attacker] were both present, but Turla was quietly active around the globe on other projects, provides some insight as to ongoing motivations and ambitions of this group.	0	other
232	Turla’s [E11:malware] KopiLuwak [E12:malware] activity does not necessarily focus on diplomatic/foreign affairs, and also winds down a different path.

239	Reporting on SPLM/[E21:malware] XAgent [E22:malware] certainly has followed this course in 2018 as SPLM/XAgent detections wind down globally, as has [E11:attacker] Sofacy [E12:attacker]’s use of this malware from our perspective.	2	use
240	This coupled with the timing of operations – which coincides with Iranian working hours – and the use of multiple Iranian hacker tools and name servers bolsters our assessment that [E11:attacker] APT33 [E12:attacker] may have operated on behalf of the [E21:location] Iranian [E22:location] government.	3	from
241	[E11:attacker] Darkhotel [E12:attacker]" is the name the group and its techniques has been given. This APT precisely drives its campaigns by spear-phishing targets with highly advanced Flash [E21:vulnerability] zero-day [E22:vulnerability] exploits that effectively evade the latest Windows and Adobe defenses, and yet they also imprecisely spread among large numbers of vague targets with peer-to-peer spreading tactics.	2	use

260	During this operation (dubbed “‘Cloud Hopper” because of the group’s use of popular western cloud-based services), [E11:attacker] APT10 [E12:attacker] utilized both new malware (Quasar RAT, Trochilus, [E21:malware] RedLeaves [E22:malware], ChChes) as well as some familiar old tools (Poison Ivy, PlugX).	2	use
261	Conclusions We are currently aware of at least four different APT actors actively using exploits of the [E21:vulnerability] CVE-2015-2545 [E22:vulnerability] vulnerability: TwoForOne (also known as Platinum), EvilPost, APT16 and [E11:attacker] Danti [E12:attacker].	2	use
262	Earlier [E11:attacker] OilRig [E12:attacker] attacks appear to use fake job offers as a social engineering theme. The campaign appears highly targeted and delivers a backdoor we have called ‘[E21:malware] Helminth [E22:malware]’.	2	use
263	In February, malware researchers at Kaspersky Lab discovered a new piece of [E21:tool] JavaScript [E22:tool] malware linked to the [E11:attacker] Turla [E12:attacker] APT group that was used in targeted attacks against organizations in Greece, Qatar, and Romania.	2	use

268	Did the Russian government direct the group responsible for the breaches and related data leaks? If so, is this simply a matter of accepted state espionage, or did it cross a line? Was the breach at the Democratic National Committee part of a concerted effort by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election? The most consequential question remains unasked: How will Russia continue to employ a variety of methods – including hacks and leaks – to undermine the institutions, policies and actors that the Russian government perceives as constricting and condemning its forceful pursuit of its state aims? FireEye’s visibility into the operations of [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker] – a group we believe the Russian government sponsors – has given us insight into some of the [E21:industry] government [E22:industry]’s targets, as well as its objectives and the activities designed to further them.	1	attack
