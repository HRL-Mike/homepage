16	According to the Ministry, the hackers did not access classified information or military secrets: “The hacked emails don’t contain military secrets, but it is of course serious,” According to the report, hackers belonging to the notorious [E11:attacker] APT28 [E12:attacker] group (also known as Pawn Storm, Sednit, [E21:attacker] Sofacy [E22:attacker], Fancy Bear and Tsar Team), were behind the attack that was part of an ongoing cyber espionage campaign that targeted the Danish Defense Ministry.	4	same
17	According to industry reporting, Chinese espionage group [E11:attacker] TEMP.Periscope [E12:attacker] has conducted large-scale [E21:technique] phishing [E22:technique], intrusion, remote access trojan (RAT), and data exfiltration activity since at least 2013.	2	use
18	The procedure is feasible because the [E11:malware] Umbreon [E12:malware] is a ring 3 (user level) [E21:technique] rootkit [E22:technique].	2	use

41	From February to September 2016, [E11:attacker] WhiteBear [E12:attacker] activity was narrowly focused on [E21:industry] embassies [E22:industry] and consular operations around the world.	1	attack
42	Zbot remained the most widespread [E21:industry] banking [E22:industry] malware family (44.08% of attacked users) but in 2016 it was actively challenged by the [E11:malware] Gozi [E12:malware] family (17.22%).	1	attack
43	Over the course of the attack campaign, we have observed two different variations of the [E11:malware] Helminth [E12:malware] backdoor, one written in [E21:tool] VBScript [E22:tool] and PowerShell that was delivered via a macro within Excel spreadsheets and the other a standalone Windows executable.	2	use
44	However, over the past few years, we have been tracking a separate, less widely known suspected [E21:location] Iranian [E22:location] group with potential destructive capabilities, whom we call [E11:attacker] APT33 [E12:attacker].	3	from

52	Figure 4 – OilRig set up a fake Oxford conference Back in December 2015, the experts from Symantec published a detailed analysis of the cyber espionage campaign conducted by two Iran-based hacker groups, dubbed Cadelle and Chafer, which used the backdoor.Cadelspy and backdoor.[E11:malware] Remexi [E12:malware] to spy on [E21:location] Iranian [E22:location] individuals and Middle Eastern organizations.	1	attack
53	[E11:attacker] WhiteBear [E12:attacker] infections appear to be preceded by a condensed [E21:technique] spearphishing [E22:technique] dropper, lack Firefox extension installer payloads, and contain several new components signed with a new code signing digital certificate, unlike WhiteAtlas incidents and modules.	2	use
54	Earlier this year, Kaspersky Labs researches suggested [E11:malware] Turla [E12:malware] as [E21:malware] Snake [E22:malware], which was built on the capabilities of Agent.Biz, the worm that came to the surface in 2008 when US Department of Defense sources claimed that its classified networks had been breached by an early version of the same virus, described by officials as the "worst breach of US military computers in history.	4	same
55	We also discovered Komplex command and control (C2) domains that overlapped with previously identified phishing campaign infrastructures associated with the Sofacy group,” researchers said. “We believe (it) may have been done in order to handle compromised Windows and OS X systems using the same C2 server application with relative ease.” “The [E11:attacker] Sofacy [E12:attacker] group created the [E21:malware] Komplex [E22:malware] Trojan to use in attack campaigns targeting the OS X operating system – a move that showcases their continued evolution toward multi-platform attacks,” they added.	2	use
